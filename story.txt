When I was in middle school, I was obsessed with the PC version of Minecraft. I would play on multiplayer servers for hours a day. One unique aspect of the game was how easy it is to add user-created mods and "hacks" to improve gameplay. 

However I got to carried away. As I learned about the power of modding, I got obsessed with adding them to minecraft. At the end of like 4 months, I had modded my minecraft so much that it could not even open.

So, I decided to fix the problem. After hours of research and reading about the mods online, I figured out which mod was causing the error. I removed the mod and restarted my computer and voila, I could go back to playing Minecraft again!

I finally got rid of the problem and enjoyed the game that I had been playing my whole life. It was a relief to play vanilla again, and this time I made sure not to break minceraft with the amount of modsI added on to it.
